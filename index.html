                    Hi, my name is Jessie Sidhu and I'm excited to take this full-stack 
                    bootcamp with everyone! I have no coding experience at the moment but 
                    i've already learned a lot in the first week!! Picking the Berkeley 
                    Bootcamp was probably the best decision I could make as I live in 
                    Hercules, CA which is 15 minutes northbound from Berkeley. All the 
                    other bootcamps I looked at were all in San Francisco and it just 
                    didn't make sense to me to commute that far.
                    <br><br>
                    My background for work is in Finance and Business Management. After 
                    college, I got a job near St. Louis, Missouri working in Finance and 
                    Budgeting; I worked there for about 3 years. I learned a lot but I 
                    really missed California! When I got back to California I semi-changed 
                    my field of work and got a job in Management working for Tesla as a 
                    Production Manager. I did seem to enjoy production a bit more than 
                    finance but at the end of the day, I still didn't seem satisfied.
                
                    In conclusion, I'm really happy I decided to join a bootcamp and do more for myself!
